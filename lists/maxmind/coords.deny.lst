-- Empty Lines and Lines starting with "--", "#", or ";" (without quotes) are ignored.

-- Format: latitude,longitude,radius,intersection
-- For the check the circle drawn by these coordinates and the radius (in kilometers)
-- and the circle drawn by MaxMind's coordinates and their accuracy radius (in kilometer)
-- are checked for an intersection. If the overlap is more than (intersection*100)% of their
-- accuracy radius, the request is blocked
-- E.g. The radii of 38.741104,-49.6676859,100 and 37.977529,-48.2432889,100 intersect about
-- 50km, i.e. ~50%
-- For an intersection >= 1 their center coordinate is fully contained within our circle


-- Ex.
38.8710323,-77.0566834,200,0.5
